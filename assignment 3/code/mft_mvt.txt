MFT Simulation:
Enter total memory size: 1000
Enter partition size: 200
Enter number of processes: 3
Memory divided into 5 partitions
Enter size of Process 1: 150
Process 1 allocated.
Enter size of Process 2: 250
Process 2 too large for fixed partition.
Enter size of Process 3: 180
Process 3 allocated.

MVT Simulation:
Enter total memory size: 1000
Enter number of processes: 3
Enter size of Process 1: 300
Process 1 allocated.
Enter size of Process 2: 500
Process 2 allocated.
Enter size of Process 3: 300
Process 3 cannot be allocated. Not enough memory.
